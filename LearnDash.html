                    <h1>Why I want to work at LearnDash</h1>
                    <p>Hi! I guess you can call this an unconventional cover letter of sorts. I created this page because I don't think a single link would accurately reflect my skills as a developer. I have been working with WordPress for three years; before that I worked mainly in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also have experience doing object oriented programming with Ruby on Rails.</p>
                    <h2>Links to projects</h2>
                    <p>The reason that these porjects are older is because most of my work since then lives within private repositories.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is a zip of a custom WordPress theme for a custom home builder I did in 2016 while working at 3thought. It is a snapshot of my ability to create with WordPress at that time.<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1o_FF5Bs1lipC5BAQpp0K7YAb71Oa-qRM"> Merz Theme</a></li>
                        <li>This is a link to the git repo of my final project at The Iron Yard. It was built with Ruby on Rails. This project represents my ability to create a project on a short time line as well as one of my first attempts at OOP.<a href="https://github.com/richsalvucci/final_project"> Golf Trax git Repo</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Thank you for taking the time to look over this page and the links that are on it. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon to discuss the position in more detail.</p>
                    <p>-Rich</p>
