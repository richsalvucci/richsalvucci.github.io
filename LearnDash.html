                    <h1>Why I want to work at LearnDash</h1>
                    <p>Hi! I guess you can call this an unconventional cover letter of sorts. The reason I created this page is I don't think a single link that would accurately refelect my skill a a developer. I have been working with WordPress for three years, before that I worked mainly in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also have expierence with object oriented programming with Ruby on Rails.</p>
                    <h2>Links to projects</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is a zip of a WordPress theme for custom home builder I did in 2016 while working at 3thought. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1o_FF5Bs1lipC5BAQpp0K7YAb71Oa-qRM"> Merz Theme</a></li>
                        <li>This is a link to the git repo of my final project at the Iron Yard. It was build with Ruby on Rails<a href="https://github.com/richsalvucci/final_project"> Golf Trax git Repo</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Thank you for taking the time to look over this page and the links that are on it. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon to discuss the position in more detail</p>
                    <p>-Rich</p>
